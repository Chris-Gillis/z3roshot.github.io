title: I Conquered the App Store

I finished my first iOS app recently and I have a few thoughts about it.

This app scratched a number of itches for me. Firstly, I wanted to have something on the app store that I could point to and say "I did that!". The specifics of the app aren't that important, just that it exists. My career thus far has been great, but it suffers from a total lack of a public portfolio of work. I decided that no job is going to build my portfolio, and even if I was able to show something public facing, there's no guarantee that it's something I did entirely. This app is different though, I can say that it's wholly mine. I chose the design, I chose the colors, I chose the workflows. I don't like typing on my phone if I don't have to, so that drove the design. Every decision had the no typing mantra in mind. In addition my wife always asks me how much to tip at restaurants. I could have just had her download one of the zillions of tip apps called "Just the Tip", but decided to make SuperTip with her in mind instead.

The second itch I wanted to scratch is kind of a corollary to the first point. I want a job in mobile development, either a day job or a consulting or even my own projects, I haven't decided yet. Apple has created an amazing platform for developers to hock their wares (distinct from warez). I have no illusions that this particular app is going to make me rich (so far I've made $5 from it, all from friends), but it was a good first foray into app development. Now I'm working on an app that I have high hopes for, and SuperTip taught me a lot that I can use on the new app.

Thirdly I wanted to exercise my UX skills. I mentioned that I had my wife and no typing in mind, but in general I just wanted an app that felt nice to use. I'm not a design guy, but I know what annoys me. I have a lot of experience being annoyed at web pages and apps.

Feel free to check out the app, it's $0.99. If you'd like it but don't want to give me a buck, let me know and I'll see if I can come up with a promo code for you (maybe I should just make it free?).
