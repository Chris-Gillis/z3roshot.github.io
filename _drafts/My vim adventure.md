My vim adventure
===

Like many coders, rails coders particularly, I want to be as hip as possible. Part of being hip these days is editing text with vim. I know a little bit now, but I want to be awesome. I want to never have to use my mouse while coding again, at least not for rails.

Here's my plan:
1. Work through vim tutor once a day for at least a couple weeks.
2. Not sure where to go from there. [Thoughtbot](learn.thoughtbot.com) has some good courses on vim. I might take a look, but I want to have basic working knowledge to get maximum benefit.
3. I hear tmux is a great productivity boost. 
4. I should look at some vim configs. Mine is kinda fubar at the moment.
