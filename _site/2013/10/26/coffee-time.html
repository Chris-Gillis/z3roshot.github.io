  <p>I’m kind of a coffee fanatic. 
I drink some every day, where some is probably 30-50 ounces (0.9 - 1.5 L if you use a sensible measurement system).
I wanted to share my coffee setup in case somebody is looking for inspiration, or if somebody knows a better way (I’d love to hear it!).</p>

<h3 id="equipment">Equipment</h3>

<p>My favorite piece of equipment is my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK">aeropress</a>. I used to use a french press from Target, and discovered the french press was great for my coffe, but this aeropress really turns up the temperature figuratively of course. It looks like a lot of pieces, but it’s not nearly as complicated as it looks.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/67781954">Just add Water on vimeo</a></p>

<p>For heating the water, I’m kind of old fashioned right now and I just use a pot to boil water on the stove. The water is filtered in my refrigerator, though I honestly can’t tell the difference between it and tap water. The trick is to keep it just below boiling temperature, around 200 F or 93 C, at least that’s what I’ve read. I haven’t done any intentional experimenting with the temperature.</p>

<p>Some will argue that the grinder is the most important point of the setup, and that’s probably true. With an aeropress, you grind the beans finely like you would for espresso, unlike the french press where you want coarsely ground beans. By the way, you gotta get whole beans and grind them at home. Switching to freshly ground coffee was the best thing I’ve ever done for my home coffee experience. Even starbucks grinds coffee freshly. <a href="http://www.coffeeanalysts.com/2011/03/coffee-packaging-and-shelf-life/">Here’s an interesting article on coffee staleness</a>.</p>

<p>I’m also considering getting an electric kettle for convenience and water pourability. I have to pour over the sink because I always spill near boiling water, and I don’t want that on my counter tops.</p>

<h3 id="coffee">Coffee</h3>

<p>This is a very important part of the operation, obviously. The best coffee I’ve ever brewed for myself comes from <a href="http://tonx.org">Tonx</a>. They source fresh coffee every couple of weeks, roast it, and immediately send it to you. It’s a bit more expensive than store bought coffee at $19 / 12 oz bag of coffee, but the quality is so much higher than store bought coffee. They also source the coffee from different parts of the world. My latest batch was from Nicaragua, and I’ve gotten coffee from Ethiopia, Costa Rica, and a few other places.</p>

<h3 id="the-process">The process</h3>

<p>So I brew more or less how the above video and though I enjoy the coffee without anything in it, I still put half and half and splenda in it. This makes a great coffee, but the important point is to enjoy your coffee, I don’t care how you make it.</p>
