  <p>I’m kind of a coffee fanatic. 
I drink some every day, where some is probably 30-50 ounces (0.9 - 1.5 L if you use a sensible measurement system).
I wanted to share my coffee setup in case somebody is looking for inspiration, or if somebody knows a better way (I’d love to hear it!).</p>

<div class="spacer-top-extra-small">
  <p>I’m building a new website in rails, and I decided to use AngularJS to make a single page application (SPA). A SPA is an application in which the page does not refresh between actions. Gmail is probably the most well known SPA. I don’t think my app needs a SPA to be successful, but it makes for a really nice user experience. And I wanted to learn AngularJS.
So far I’ve had a couple problems that have slowed me down, and I wanted to document them here.</p>

  <p>I’ve subscribed to behavior driven development for a long time now. I use the
word subscribe here to mean I read about it, and I talk about it, but I haven’t
yet implemented it on any of my projects. Well I decided to actually give it a
shot on a project I started recently, and it’s even better than I expected it to
be!</p>

I thought it was so clever when I first heard it. I don’t have a MacBook, but oh boy, the first thing I do when I get one is set that up. </p>
